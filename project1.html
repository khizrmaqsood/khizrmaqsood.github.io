                City Health Tech is a startup that provides a wireless-connected handwashing device, the Opal, and 
                IoT platform to help promote healthier handwashing habits while collecting pertinent handwashing data to help communities live healthier.
                I joined City Health Tech in February 2020 as an industrial designer!

                    The Opal is a handwash assistant that sits on sinks and displays engaging animations to ensure that users wash their hands for a full 
                    20 seconds. The Opal automatically detects when someone approaches the sink using a proximity sensor.  
                    When I joined, the Opal was at its early prototyping stages as CHT was primarily testing its functionality as a device. 
                    Clearly, the physical dimensions and aesthetics of the Opal were a secondary concern at this point.

                <p>
                    I was employed to help develop a vision for the future of the Opal’s design. My day-to-day tasks, however, 
                    involved helping the design team refine this prototype’s form factor.

            <p>This is my redesigned Opal. Our intention was to design a product that, despite its unusual appearance, integrates 
                seamlessly with a variety of bathroom environments. The chrome accents on the sides provide a natural extension of 
                silver taps and drain, and the paint’s metallic finish gently plays with the reflections of fluorescent lights. The 
                rounded, friendly form of the original prototype was maintained to make the Opal appear approachable. The smaller size 
                will be achieved by manufacturing our own custom PCB and custom LCD display. This is the device that will be available in Summer 2021!
